# PyGears

PyGears is a 2d, tiling game engine leveraging Qt and OpenGL. It's primarily
serves as a teaching tool for a group of determined students at Vanderbilt
University, who decided to improve their experience at school by committing to
learn team development, version control, and Python.


## Dependencies

PyGears depends explicitly on PyOpenGL and Pyside. These, in turn, have
dependencies on OpenGL libs (included in most operating systems) and Qt
libs. See the docs for [instructions on setting up the dev environment](https://github.com/vandycs/pygears/blob/master/docs/development.md).
